# @ngix/store

### NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.

IxJS augmented state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux and built upon [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform).

`@ngix/store` is an attempt to implement an even more functional approach to `@ngrx`. This library is not a replacement for `@ngrx`, but rather a companion library.

Core tenents:

- Play happily and seemlessly with `@ngrx`.
- Less Action and Reducer boilerplate.
- One agnostic reducer. Anonymous actions.
- Keep all store logic in one place. One file.
- Lively data with optimistic updates.
- Stay small and simple.
- Functions, functions, functions.

### Installation
Install @ngix/store from npm:

`npm install @ngix/store --save`

### Docs and Examples Coming Soon

Stay tuned...
